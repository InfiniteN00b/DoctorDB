\chapter{Tools Used}
\section{React JS}
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It was developed and is maintained by Facebook, and is now widely used by many companies and organizations to build web applications. React allows developers to build reusable UI components, which can be easily composed to create complex user interfaces.

One of the key features of React is its use of a virtual DOM (Document Object Model). The virtual DOM is a lightweight representation of the actual DOM, and React updates the virtual DOM in response to changes in the underlying data. This allows React to efficiently update only the parts of the UI that have changed, rather than re-rendering the entire page.

React also uses a component-based architecture, which allows developers to organize their code into self-contained, reusable components. Each component can manage its own state and props, which are inputs that can be passed to the component from its parent. This makes it easy to reason about the behavior of different parts of the application, and allows for easy testing and maintenance.

React also has a large and active community, and there are many libraries and tools available to help with common tasks and to extend the functionality of the library. Additionally, React is compatible with other libraries and frameworks, such as Redux and MobX, which can be used to manage the application's state in a more efficient way.

Overall, React is a powerful and flexible tool for building complex web applications, and is widely used in industry to build web applications with high performance and user experience.
\section{MUI framework }
Material-UI is a popular user interface library for React that follows the Material Design guidelines created by Google. Material Design is a design system that provides a consistent visual language for web and mobile applications. The Material-UI library provides a set of pre-built components, such as buttons, forms, and navigation elements, that can be easily integrated into a React application, allowing developers to quickly create a visually consistent and polished user interface.

One of the key features of Material-UI is its use of the Material-UI theme, which allows developers to customize the look and feel of the components in the library. The theme can be configured to change the color palette, typography, and spacing of the components. Material-UI also provides a set of utility classes, such as spacing and alignment, that can be used to further customize the layout of the components.

Material-UI also provides a wide range of components that can be used to build complex user interfaces, such as data tables, forms, and dialogs. These components are designed to be highly customizable and can be easily integrated into a React application. Additionally, Material-UI has support for server-side rendering, accessibility, and internationalization, making it a suitable choice for a wide range of applications.

Overall, Material-UI is a powerful and feature-rich library that can help developers quickly create visually consistent and polished user interfaces for their React applications, by following the Material Design guidelines. It is widely used in industry and has a large and active community, providing a variety of resources and tools to help developers with their projects.
\section{MySql database}
MySQL is a widely used open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). It is designed to handle large amounts of data and is well-suited for use in web and mobile applications, online transaction processing, and data warehousing. MySQL is also known for its reliability, stability and ease of use.

MySQL uses the SQL (Structured Query Language) for data manipulation and management. SQL is a standard programming language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. This allows developers to easily create, read, update and delete data in the database, as well as create and manage tables and other database structures.

MySQL also provides a variety of features that are useful for high-performance, high-availability and scalability. These features include support for transactions, stored procedures, and triggers, as well as support for replication and partitioning. These features allow developers to create databases that can handle large amounts of data, and can be easily scaled to meet the needs of growing applications.

MySQL also has a large and active community, which provides a variety of resources and tools for developers. This includes a wide range of third-party libraries, tools, and connectors that can be used to easily connect to MySQL from a variety of programming languages and platforms.

Overall, MySQL is a powerful, reliable, and easy-to-use relational database management system that is well-suited for a wide range of applications, from small to large scale projects. It is widely used in industry and known for its stability, performance and scalability, making it a suitable choice for a wide range of projects.

\section{Node JS}
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server side. It is built on the V8 JavaScript engine developed by Google and uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it well-suited for building high-performance, real-time web applications.

One of the key features of Node.js is its ability to handle many concurrent connections with high throughput, making it a popular choice for building real-time, data-intensive applications such as chat, gaming, and stock trading platforms. Node.js also has a large and active community, which provides a wide range of modules and packages through the Node Package Manager (NPM) that can be easily integrated into Node.js applications. This allows developers to easily add functionality to their applications, such as connecting to a database, handling HTTP requests, and working with files and directories.

Node.js also provides a built-in web server, making it easy to build web applications. It also supports a variety of popular web development frameworks, such as Express.js, which simplifies the development of web applications by providing a set of tools for handling routing, middleware, and other server-side tasks.

Overall, Node.js is a versatile and powerful tool for building high-performance web applications. Its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, and its large and active community, makes it a suitable choice for a wide range of projects and it's widely used in industry for building web applications and APIs.
